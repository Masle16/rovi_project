# Rapidly-exploring Random Trees Connect

This folder contains the code for performing the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees Connect algorithm in the RobWorkStudio [scene](Project_WorkCell/scene.wv.xml).

## Task description

In order to execute the pick and place action, you are asked to calculate the robot trajectories for this specific task.
To do so use the RRT connect algorithm to plan the trajectory.
Test the performance with at least 3 different pick location of the object in the scene.
