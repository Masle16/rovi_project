# Robotics and Vision, RoVi, Project

7. semester rovi project.

## Robotics

### Reachability Analysis

The reachability analysis is located in [reachability_analysis](reachability_analysis), this folder contains the [code](reachability_analysis/src/main.cpp), the [dataprocessing of side](reachability_analysis/cylinder_side/collision_free_solutions_side.m), the [dataprocessing of top](reachability_analysis/cylinder_top/collision_free_solutions_top.m) and the [figures for the report](reachability_analysis/figures). Further description can be found in the [README](reachability_analysis/README.md).

### Robot Motion Planing

**Point to Point Interpolation**

**Point to Point Interpolation with Parabolic Blend**

**Rapidly Random Trees Connect (RRT Connect)**

## Vision

### Simulated Depth Sensor

The simulated depth sensor method is located in [simulated_depth_sensor](simulated_depth_sensor), this folder contains the [code](simulated_depth_sensor/src/main.cpp), the [dataprocessing](simulated_depth_sensor/analysis_of_results.m) and the [figures for the report](simulated_depth_sensor/figures). Further description can be found in the [README](simulated_depth_sensor/README.md).
