\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}
This report goes through five different methods related to pick and place of objects using a Universal Robots robot arm in a simulated environment using RobWorks \cite{robwork}. The first three methods are related to moving the object from the pick location to the place location and the last two methods are for detecting the object and determining a pose using computer vision. Lastly, a combination is put together to perform a complete pick and placement.

The code for the project can be found at \cite{code}.

\subsection*{Notation}
Throughout the report transformation and pose will be used interchangeably, both denote the homogeneous transformation matrix.
